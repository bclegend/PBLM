## Power Bed Laser Melting
In metal powder bed 3D printing, defects can arise during the powder spreading process. Metal Powder Bed Laser Melting Additive Manufacturing involves repetitively spreading metal powder onto a bed and melting it with a laser to build up the product layer by layer. Improper powder spreading can occur due to various factors, resulting in defects in the final product. Therefore, inspecting each powder layer after it is spread can help reduce the likelihood of defects in the final product.

The dataset consists of five categories: four types of defects and one category of defect-free data, each stored in separate compressed files named according to the defect type. The task is to develop a suitable classification model for image classification. If the dataset is insufficient, data augmentation techniques should be employed to enhance it.
